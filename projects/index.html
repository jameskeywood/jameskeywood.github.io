			Below is a list of projects that I have worked on in the past.
			<hr>
			<h3>1st year team project [2023-2024]</h3>
			In a team of 7, we used a frontend of HTML + JS + Chart.js + CSS alongside a backend of Flask + SQLite3 to create a fitness web application.<br>
			The application allowed for workout and nutrition input, with a login and user system.<br>
			Users were able to see graphs and analysis based on their performance.<br>
			<hr>
			<h3>GMTK Game Jam 2023 [2023-2023]</h3>
			In this 48 hour game jam, I was the sole developer in a team of 3, my teammates covering 3D models and music.<br>
			With the theme being 'Roles Reversed', we created a Unity game called 'Ninja Fruit' in which the player takes the role of the fruit and destroys enemies.<br>
			This game can be found on my <a href="https://jameskeywood.itch.io/">itch.io</a> page.
			<hr>
			<h3>A-level Computer Science NEA [2022-2023]</h3>
			This project acted as an introduction to Unity for myself, and I was able to create a game including but not limited to:
			<ul>
				<li>Random landmass generation using Perlin noise</li>
				<li>Simple plant growth mechanics</li>
				<li>Character movement systems</li>
				<li>Scoring and currency</li>
				<li>Saving to local machine</li>
			</ul>
			This also included a project write up, and the game can be found on my <a href="https://jameskeywood.itch.io/">itch.io</a> page.
