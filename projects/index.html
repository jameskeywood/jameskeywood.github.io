			<h3>Starmapper [2024-2024]</h3>
			Manchester University Student Hackathon 2024, with a theme of 'cosmic'.<br>
			Within this 24 hour period, myself and two team members created a web application to process images of the night sky.<br>
			One function counts and highlights any stars or clusters in the image.<br>
			The other uses a trained machine learning model to inform the user which constellation, if any, is in their image.
			<h3>lightr [2023-2024]</h3>
			For my first year team project, the 7 of us used a frontend of HTML + JS + Chart.js + CSS alongside a backend of Flask + SQLite3 to create a fitness web application.<br>
			The application allowed for workout and nutrition input, with a login and user system.<br>
			Users were able to see graphs and analysis based on their performance.
			<h3>Ninja Fruit [2023-2023]</h3>
			In the GMTK 48 hour game jam, I was the sole developer in a team of 3, my teammates covering 3D models and music.<br>
			With the theme being 'Roles Reversed', we created a play on the classic game Fruit NinjaÂ®.<br>
			The player takes the role of the fruit and destroys enemies, and the game can be found on my <a href="https://jameskeywood.itch.io/">itch.io</a> page.
			<h3>A-level Computer Science NEA [2022-2023]</h3>
			For my A-level Computer Science NEA, I made a Unity game focused on gardening.
			This project acted as an introduction to Unity, and I was able to implement features including but not limited to:
			<ul>
				<li>Random landmass generation using Perlin noise</li>
				<li>Simple plant growth mechanics</li>
				<li>Character movement systems</li>
				<li>Scoring and currency</li>
				<li>Saving to local machine</li>
			</ul>
			This also included a project write up, and the game can be found on my <a href="https://jameskeywood.itch.io/">itch.io</a> page.
			<h3>Level 3 Extended Project Qualification [2021-2022]</h3>
			I used this dissertation as an opportunity to research machine learning and image generation.<br>
			Exploring the Generative Adversarial Network was very interesting, and has become even more prevelent today.<br>
			In the time that I had, I discussed multiple different models and their applications.<br>
			During this period I researched image generation practically using Python, which can be viewed in my <a href="https://github.com/jameskeywood/geno">GitHub</a> repository.
